Thanks partly to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's checkbook, gun control advocates spent $17 million on the 2018 elections, compared with $14 million for gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research group. The figures included both campaign donations and independent expenditures. Four year earlier, the gun rights side outspent the gun control side, $31 million to $423,750. Three of New Jersey's four freshmen were supported by gun control advocates. Rep. Andy Kim, D-3rd Dist., backed by both Giffords and Brady, ousted Republican incumbent Tom MacArthur, who co-sponsored the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. That measure, which passed the House but not the Senate, would have required New Jersey to honor concealed weapons permits for people who got them in their home states, like they now do for driver's licenses. And Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-11th Dist., won her congressional race with the support of both gun control advocacy groups. \n",

Hundreds of followers of Ghazi and his brother, the imprisoned Maulana Abdul Aziz, streamed in, many flashing victory signs. Apr. 18, 2009 update: The Lal Masjid imam, Abdul Aziz Ghazi, released from nearly two years of house arrest, returned to the mosque yesterday and renewed the call for the application of Islamic law in Pakistan. \"If the government wants peace and stability, it should adopt the Islamic system,\" he said. \"But if it chooses the path of aggression and force, it will further aggravate the situation.\" One can expect much more trouble ahead from this mosque.

To my extreme luck, they also have a number of licensed beauty products — Disney, Marvel, and The Simpsons — are some of what you can find. While normally I would go for any Disney product, The Simpsons products were too unique for me to pass up. For $24 I got three sheet masks, sunscreen, and hand cream. Not bad at all, and the packaging is really awesome. Today I tried the Lisa face mask, which touts itself as a size small. To be fair, it is a smaller than normal face mask, but it still covered my adult-size face well. By the way, these are supposed to make you look like the characters — so they’re mildly horrifying (like that Hello Kitty mask). But they do feel amazing on the skin.

This means the ICC could only act on the complaint against Xi if it were filed by the Philippine government when it was still a member of the international tribunal. China did not sign the Rome Statute in 1998 and therefore has since not been a member of ICC. The Philippines, on the other hand, withdrew its membership from the ICC in March last year, which took effect last March 17. “These jurisdictional requirements are obviously not met, so we expect the ICC to dismiss the complaint,” he said. The Philippine government withdrew its membership from the ICC after a complaint was filed against President Duterte over his bloody war against illegal drugs.

According to Garzon’s brother, Alfredo Garzon, his murder was orchestrated by high level military officials with cooperation of the paramilitary leader Carlos Castaño. However, after 15 years of without anyone being held accountable for his murder, it would seem the search for the truth surrounding Garzon’s assassination is making progress. Despite the fact that six key witnesses regarding the Garzon case have been murdered, there may still be hope and justice for the Garzon family. This year’s anniversary comes in the midst of the arrest of retired army colonel, Jorge Eliecer Plazas. According to the testimonies of paramilitaries, Plazas was central in the army’s planning of the murder of Garzon. “The capture of Plazas Acevedo is excellent news for our judicial process because it gets us closer to the truth. The connections the military has with those that committed the crime are beginning to be clear,” said Alfredo Garzon in an interview with El Espectador. The trial of former intelligence agency (DAS) director José Miguel Narvaez also began last year. “The orders came from high up the military command and this is not a theory, this has been super proven,” said Garzon’s brother. \n",

District Attorney Kevin Steele wants some of them to speak at the sentencing. O'Neill on Wednesday ruled out the testimony of most of the other accusers, other than the five trial witnesses. But whether any of them testify, he already knows their stories well after presiding at both trials and several intense pretrial hearings over their “prior bad act” testimony. “The judge knows a ton about Mr. Cosby whether or not the D.A. puts on a single witness,” Filler said. O'Neill, who is married and has three adult sons, took the bench in 2002. He has watched the Cosby team's attacks on the court system intensify, and grow more personal, as the stakes grew. Lawyer Samuel Stretton, who often represents Pennsylvania judges in disciplinary hearings, called O'Neill an even-keeled professional who “understands human nature.” He doesn't think the attacks will influence the sentence — but said Cosby's lack of remorse might. “Obviously, if no one is repenting, that's a factor to consider. And if they're so unrepentant they're name calling, blaming anyone but themselves,” that's a problem, Stretton said. \n",

I also found the light balance of the photos to be fairly accurate with no adjustment. When I shot a person standing in front of a bright light source, the person's image darkened somewhat but didn't lose all detail, as happens with many low-quality cameras. The camera did, however, have trouble auto-focusing quickly on fast-moving objects in the frame -- in this case, oncoming traffic. LG says that the NOVA screen on the Optimus Black \"reduces power consumption by 50 percent during general indoor use compared to a conventional LCD [display].\" Though we could not perform formal tests on the Optimus's 1500mAh battery, its battery burn rate during my testing looked promising. I charged the battery completely, and then commenced testing -- which involved using various aspects of the phone, including battery-intensive tasks like HD video viewing and shooting video. The testing regimen included an overnight of pure standby time as well. But 24 hours later, I still had 63 percent of the battery left. Relative to many other smartphones I've tested, that's very good. \n",
