Gibney on\\t December 10, 2021 Polish Artist\\nCanadian singer-songwriter Collin Clowes captures the moments that matter in his evocative new single, \"Polaroid\" – available now.\\nThe new single from the debut EP, Sleepy, the seven song release in 2021 is a collection of heartwarming songs that feature delicate instrumental compositions over meaningful lyrics to create a sound that\\'s as familiar as it is new. This musical body is the singular vision of Clowes, who not only plays each instrument, but also works through a painstaking effort of production, mixing and mastering.\\nPersistence, along with a steadfast commitment to the music creation process, sets artist Collin Clowes in a league of their own. The production value and rhythmic polish of the EP is more typically associated with high-value teams of musicians and producers, not with the debut of a single artist, and Clowes ear for pop melodies and the multi-layered vocals reveal a mature sound texture. beyond his years.\\nThe touching lyrics of \"Polaroid\" are a vivid example of Clowes\\' ability to tell stories that go far beyond the superficiality that seems central in media.\\n\"Look around, tell me what you see,\\nAre there any fragmented memories stained on your sleeves,\\nOr did I leave here way too soon?\\nYou took a Polaroid photo to capture your past,\\nyou wear it closer because nothing really lasts now, does it? \"\\nThe complexity of our memories and our taste for better days are elegantly expressed in melancholic sounds and lyrics that give the song a sense of timelessness. The thoughtfulness employed in every musical endeavor reflects the perspective that Clowes brings to life. Each decision taken on the EP demonstrates exceptional depth and authenticity, welcoming and relevant.\\nA multi-talented artist from Gorham / Thunder Bay, Ontario, Collin Clowes exudes a true sense of artistic compassion that effortlessly translates into all aspects of his musical debut.\\nAfter constant health battles from the age of 17, Clowes made the decision to devote his time to making the music he wanted. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, Clowes decided to start planning for what is now the Sleepy EP. In his bedroom studio, he would acquire the skills to realize his unique vision of pop music through countless hours of musical trial and error.\\nThis EP is dedicated to Clowes\\' faithful companion and best friend – her dog, June. It is said that when a person saves an animal, the reverse also occurs; this was the case with his beloved June. Endlessly loved by Clowes, June was his biggest supporter, helping him through countless nights of hard work throughout the production of Sleepy.\\nCollin Clowes\\' sensational single, \"Polaroid\", from his debut EP, Sleepy, is out now.\\nChoreographer Laurieann Gibson \"Icon\" of the Talent Development Competition – Deadline\\nTwo remain (out of darkness) – Isthmus\\nLaura E. Hall explains how escape rooms are more like video games than you might think\\nAdele\\'s \\'30\\' is imperfect, but her voice is perfect'}"

USA came into the final defeating England 2-1 whereas Netherlands entered the final courtesy a 1-0 win over Sweden.\\nPreview, prediction, schedule\\nThe three-time world champions USA are coming into the final riding high on a hard fought win against England. They have been in magnificent form throughout the tournament and have not lost a single match. However, their star player and probably the player of the tournament Megan Rapinoe was out of the semi-final clash due to a hamstring injury. But the USA team management have announced that she will be fit for the final. The loss of such a big player would have been a major setback for the team. With her in the team, they will be looking forward to adding another trophy to their collection.\\nOn the other hand, Netherlands who are now oozing with confidence after qualifying for the final, came into the cup decider by beating Sweden in a hard fought 1-0 win. The sole goal of the match came in the 99th minute. The 2017 European champions will be hoping that their star player Lieke Martens performs up to her usual high standard and gets fit for the final. She was one of the reasons behind the 2017 triumph so her presence will be very vital for the Orange Brigade.\\nThe USA definitely have the upper hand over first time finalist Netherlands and are, definitely, the favourite to win. But Netherlands, who have been unbeaten for the last 12 matches, will not let them win easily. An exciting match is on the cards.\\nThe USA-Netherlands match will start at 5 PM on July 7 according to local time and 11 pm, July 7 according to SGT.\\nGlobal TV listings\\nUSA: Fox, FS1 (English)\\nUSA: Universo, Telemundo (Spanish)\\nUK: BBC\\nAustralia: Optus Sport\\nCanada: CTV, RDS, TSN\\nSub-Saharan Africa: DirecTV Sports\\nCristiano Ronaldo visits Singapore before Juventus\\' arrival\\nSweden defeats Germany 2-1 to enter Women\\'s world cup semis\\nWomen\\'s World cup: Dutch women beat Italy to reach semis for 1st time\\nCricket World Cup final: ICC brazenly refuses to comment on umpires\\' big mistake\\nAfter staying silent for two days, cricket\\'s chief governing body finally...\\nWimbledon, British GP and Cricket World Cup all happened in one Sunday [PHOTOS]\\nIt was one of the best as well as exciting Sundays as all these three...\\nNovak Djokovic takes 5th Wimbledon trophy beating Roger Federer\\nThe Wimbledon men\\'s tennis final ended after more than four hours of a...\\nDramatic British GP ends with Lewis Hamilton\\'s victory [VIDEO]\\nThe British GP was supposed to be the battle for the top place, but the...\\nSimona Halep wins Wimbledon 2019 Women\\'s singles title\\nThe Romanian became the first singles champion at the oldest Grand Slam...\\nSerena Williams vs Simona Halep match details: Watch Wimbledon women\\'s final Live\\nCheck here to know Serena Williams vs Simona Halep match details and how...\\nSlow batting, a bad shot and two magical deliveries!
